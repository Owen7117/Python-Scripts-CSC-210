input
store n /store input 
subt two / take away 2 becuase of the starting incase the user asks for place 0,1,2
store n

skipcond 000 / while n is less 0 skip next line 
jump checkcount / jump to check count if it is 0 or greater meaning input was 2 which will output 1
add one / add 1 to n 
store n
skipcond 000 / while n is less than 0 skip next line 
jump checkcount/ jump to check count meaning input was 1
add one / add 1 to n 
output / this means the input was 0 so the ouput will also be zero 
halt / stop the program
           
/ check n value subroutine     
checkcount,		load n 
				Skipcond 800 / while n is greater than 0 skip next line
				jump outputnextnum / nextnum output will start off as 1 but get bigger each run
				subt one / n-1
                store n
                load num1
                subt num1 / num1 = 0
                add num2 / add num2's value 
                store num1 / make num1 = num2 so it takes the next folowing numbers place 
                load num2
                subt num2 / num2 = 0
                add nextnum / add nextnum's value 
                store num2/ make num2 = nextnum so it takes the next numbers place
                load nextnum
                subt nextnum / make nextnum 0 
                add num1 
                add num2
   				store nextnum / add num1 and num2 together to find the next number and store the total
                jump checkcount /repeat the loop until n is 0
                
/output subroutine
outputnextnum, 	load nextnum / will either be 1 or the final number
				output / display the number 
                halt / stop the program 


n, dec 0 
/ set the first 3 indexes of the sequence
num1, dec 0 
num2, dec 1
nextnum, dec 1 
/ set one and two for addition and subtraction purposes 
one, dec 1
two, dec 2
